Detailed Requirements: The Chatbot & Live Chat System ü§ñüí¨
This document outlines the core functional and non-functional requirements for the custom-built customer engagement platform.

1. User-Facing Chat Interface
1.1 AI-Powered Chatbot: The system will feature an AI-driven chatbot that greets users and provides a menu of services via clickable buttons. The chatbot's conversational flow and button-based navigation will be fully configurable.

1.2 Live Agent Transfer: The chatbot will be programmed to recognize when it cannot resolve a query and will offer to transfer the user to a live agent. This transfer will be triggered automatically or by a user request.

1.3 Chat History: The system will display the full chat history, including both the AI's responses and the user's messages, providing seamless context during the transfer to a live agent.

1.4 Session Management: The chat session will persist across the user's browsing experience, allowing them to return to an ongoing conversation without losing context.

2. The Live Chat Agent Interface
2.1 Agent Dashboard Access: Live chat agents will access and manage conversations through a dedicated dashboard. This includes viewing incoming chats, accepting them, and responding to users.

2.2 Chat Context: Upon accepting a chat, the agent will see the complete transcript of the conversation with the AI chatbot, providing full context before they begin assisting.

2.3 Real-Time Communication: Agents will be able to engage with users in real-time, including sending and receiving text, and potentially media files.

3. The Central Dashboard & Ticket System üñ•Ô∏è
3.1 Comprehensive Dashboard: A central dashboard will serve as the hub for all chat engagements. It will display key metrics and an overview of active and resolved chats.

3.2 Ticket Creation: When a chat cannot be resolved by the AI, it will be automatically converted into a pending ticket on the dashboard. These tickets will be the primary method for agents and teams to address unresolved queries.

3.3 Department-Based Routing: The system will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the chat content and route the newly created ticket to the appropriate department. For example, a chat about "pricing" or "features" would be directed to the Sales department.

3.4 User & Department Management: The dashboard will include a user management module where administrators can add new users, assign them to specific departments (e.g., Sales, Support, Technical), and manage their permissions.

3.5 Ticket Locking & Ownership: Once a team member from the relevant department opens a ticket, it will be locked. This ensures only one person can work on it at a time, preventing multiple agents from responding to the same user or joining the same live chat session. This ownership will be clearly visible on the dashboard.

3.6 Chat Transcripts: All chat conversations, from the initial AI interaction to the live agent's part, will be saved and linked to the ticket for future review, quality control, and training.

4. Notifications & Communication
4.1 Email Notifications: When the AI creates a new ticket and routes it to a department, the system will automatically send an email notification to all members of that department.

4.2 System Alerts: The dashboard will include visual or audio alerts for new tickets, ensuring agents don't miss incoming requests.
